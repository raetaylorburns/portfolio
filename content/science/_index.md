I am currently pursuing a  Ph.D. at the University of California Santa Cruz. My research focuses on the impacts of climate change on coastlines, and how coastal habitat can increase resiliency to storms and rising sea levels. I also work at the United States Geological Survey office in Santa Cruz. 

In 2018 I obtained a Masterâ€™s degree at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at UC Santa Barbara, focusing on coastal and marine resource management, and in 2015 a B.S. in environmental engineering from Yale College.

My goal a a scientist is to develop solutions that aid coastal communities and planners in coping with a changing climate.
